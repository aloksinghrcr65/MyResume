        <strong><em>CPU SCHEDULING SIMULATOR</em></strong>
        <hr size="2" color="black">
        <br>
        <b>Description :-</b>
        <p>CPU Scheduling is a process of determing which process will own CPU for execution
            <br>and for what time and in what order while another process is on hold.
            <br>The main task of CPU scheduling is to make sure that whenever the CPU remains
            <br>idle, the OS atleast select one of the process available in the ready queue
            <br>for execution. The selection of process will be carried out by the CPU Scheduler.
            <br>It selects one of the process from memory that are ready for execution.
            <br>
            <br>In this project, i have use 1 non-preemptive scheduling algorithm i.e. 
            <br>First Come, First Serve(FCFS) CPU scheduling Algorithm and 3 preemptive
            <br>scheduling algorithm i.e. One is Shortest Job First(SJF) CPU scheduling,
            <br>second is Shortest Remaining Time First(SRTF) CPU scheduling and third is 
            <br>Round Robim(RR) CPU scheduling.

        <strong><em>HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</em></strong>
        <hr size="2" color="black">
        <br>
        <b>Description :-</b>
        <p>A Hospital Management System (HMS) is a Desktop based application that helps to manage
            <br>the activity of a hospital like patient management, doctor management, manage 
            <br>appointments, and also manage the records of patient.
            <br>The main objective to develop a HMS is to manage the hospital activity in easy way
            <br>and it help to reduce the paper work. In many cases patient lost their medical
            <br>report or otherwise forgot to take them to hospital. So, this application will help them.
            <br>
            <br>In this project, there will be 8 main modules i have add in this project which are as follows:- 
            <br> <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                <li>Admin Module</li>
                <li>Doctor Module</li>
                <li>Receptionist Module</li>
                <li>Labortrary Module</li>
                <li>Pharmacy Module</li>
                <li>Nurse Module</li>
                <li>HR Module</li>
                <li>Nurse Module</li>
            </ol> </p>
